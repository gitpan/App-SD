How to get the SD Redmine sync tests working
--------------------------------------------

* Install Net::Redmine and any other dependencies of the Redmine sync listed
  in Makefile.PL

* You need access to an instance of a recent version of a Redmine instance with
  a test project. You can run a Redmine instance locally by downloading it from
  here:
  - http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Download

  Follow the installation instructions here:
  - http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/RedmineInstall

  Once you have a local server up and running (probably under WEBrick, go to
  http://localhost:3000/, login with username 'admin', password 'admin'. Create
  a project named 'test'.

* Set NET_REDMINE_TEST to "http://localhost:3000/projects/test admin admin"
  (Sub in different test project URL and username/password if yours are
  different.)

* Tests should at least run now. This foreign sync module is experimental as
  of yet; some of them may fail. The tests also currently depend on having
  no issues in the redmine test project when they start right now, so you'll
  need to clear tickets by going to the "issues" UI for the test project in a
  browser, selecting all the issues by clicking the green checkbox, and then
  right-clicking in the table to bring up a menu that you can delete them
  from.

* In the future, we should make it so these tests require less setup on the
  part of the developer, and maybe create a new redmine project for every
  run (or some other way of not needing to manually delete tickets after
  every run).
